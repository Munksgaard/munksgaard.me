* Yesterday, and the plan for today

Yesterday, I got managed to get a better version of my last-use analysis to
work. It still doesn't handle aliasing properly, but I think it's good enough
that I can adapt my linear-scan to use it instead of the old last-use. I also
really need to write the pseudo-code for my linear scan for Cosmin, today.

* Linear-scan

So, after figthting with scoping for a bit, I think linear scan works a lot
better now. I'll write some more about the status tomorrow. And write the
pseudo-code...
