* Benchmarking and graphing the results

I should really copy the code to my array20-paper repository and set up the
right datasets.

Two datasets for each benchmark? Sure.

** TODO Get futhark benchmark results

*** DONE LUD

*** TODO BFast

There is only one benchmark for regular bfast. There are two for bfast-cloudy,
however. Should we just use that instead? And is there a hand-written benchmark
we can compare to?

*** DONE Heston

*** DONE OptionPricing

*** DONE BackProp

*** DONE LavaMD

*** DONE nw

*** DONE nn

Due to errors in the compiler in the specific version I'm using, this benchmark
doesn't work.

*** DONE SRAD

Due to errors in the compiler in the specific version I'm using, this benchmark
doesn't work.

*** DONE Pathfinder

Due to errors in the compiler in the specific version I'm using, this benchmark
doesn't work.

** TODO Get handwritten benchmark results

*** TODO LUD

*** TODO BFast

*** TODO Heston

*** TODO OptionPricing

*** TODO BackProp

*** TODO LavaMD

* New GPG keys

I've created a new GPG key for myself, here's the hash:
[[file:../publickey.txt][4CE62A90EFC0B9B2]]

[[file:~/src/munksgaard.me/publickey.txt][file:~/src/munksgaard.me/publickey.txt]]

It is set to expire in 2022, so [[https://www.g-loaded.eu/2010/11/01/change-expiration-date-gpg-key/][here]] is some information for myself on how to
change the expiration date.
