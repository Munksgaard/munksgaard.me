* Benchmarking and graphing the results

* New GPG keys

I've created a new GPG key for myself, here's the hash:
[[file:~/src/munksgaard.me/publickey.txt][4CE62A90EFC0B9B2]]

6A18A9D84FB4AE5173030E33648E19638AA008ED

It is set to expire in 2022, so [[https://www.g-loaded.eu/2010/11/01/change-expiration-date-gpg-key/][here]] is some information for myself on how to
change the expiration date.
