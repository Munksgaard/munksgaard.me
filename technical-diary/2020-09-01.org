* AP

I'm a TA for AP in this block. I expect it's going to take up a significant
chunk of my time, but we'll see. Today, we had a meeting, and I worked on
improving the OnlineTA system a bit.

* Ormolu

Ormolu is now used to format all Futhark code!

I probably need to rebase my reuse-allocations PR. Done.
