* More sexps

I'm still working on making a nicer sexp-based represention of
Futhark. Yesterday, Troels made a handful of improvements to [[https://github.com/diku-dk/futhark/pull/1078][my PR]], and today
I've continued the work a bit. Unfortunately, there are still [[https://github.com/esmolanka/sexp-grammar/pull/16][some]] [[https://github.com/esmolanka/sexp-grammar/issues/15][issues]] with
sexp-grammar that need to be fixed before we can merge anything.

It looks better now! We still need to wait for nix to update their haskell
packages though. And for some reason, stack needs [[https://github.com/diku-dk/futhark/pull/1078/commits/2b9cdaa49ac5c37baed1f0f7e79137cec38324f6][this]]?
