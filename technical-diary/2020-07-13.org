* Yesterday, and the plan for today

On Friday, I managed to get my allocation optimizer pass working. However, there
are a lot of shortcomings, and the last-use analysis is not up to scratch.

Today, I'll give an honest attempt at trying to port Cosmins pass so I can use
that instead of my own.

* Last-use, again

Lot's of work to be done.

* Tomorrow

It'd be nice to be able to present my current progress in a nice manner to
Cosmin and the others. Can I write some pseudocode for the algorithm as it looks
so far?
